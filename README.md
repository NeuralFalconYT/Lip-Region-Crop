## Install
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
## Run Lip Detection
1. Open lip_detection.py.
2. Update the video path or use the webcam by commenting out the other option.
```
# Uncomment the one you want to use and comment out the other
video_path= "./video.mp4"  # Path to the video file
# video_path="0"  # Use webcam (0 for default webcam, 1, 2, and so on for other cameras)
```

## If you want to add the original video's audio to the extracted lip video: 
```
python mix_audio.py extracted_lip_video.mp4 original_video.mp4 temp.mp3 output_video_name.mp4
```
#### Example:
Suppose you provided ```"video.mp4"``` to ```lip_detection.py```, which created ```"temp.mp4"```. ```"temp.mp3"``` is a temporary audio file for the extracted audio, and you want to create a final video named ```"lip_audio.mp4"``` that includes both the video and audio.
Use the following command:
```
python mix_audio.py temp.mp4 video.mp4 temp.mp3 lip_audio.mp4
```
Here's what each argument represents:

- ```temp.mp4```: The video file generated by lip_detection.py.
- ```video.mp4```: The original video file containing the desired audio.
- ```temp.mp3```: A temporary file name for the extracted audio.
- ```lip_audio.mp4```: The name of the final video file with the merged audio.
